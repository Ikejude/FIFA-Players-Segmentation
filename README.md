# FIFA Players Segmentation using K-means Clustering
This repository contains an unsupervised machine learning model for segmenting FIFA players based on their attributes using the K-means clustering algorithm. The model aims to group players with similar characteristics, allowing for better analysis and insights into player profiles.

## Dataset
The model uses a dataset comprised of FIFA player attributes and performance statistics. The dataset includes various player attributes such as age, nationality, overall rating, position, and other relevant features. These attributes serve as input variables for the K-means clustering algorithm.

## Model Description
The segmentation model employs the K-means clustering algorithm, a popular unsupervised learning technique. K-means clustering divides the players into clusters based on their attribute similarities, forming groups of players with comparable characteristics.

Key steps of the model include:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the input data to ensure consistency and suitability for clustering. This may involve handling missing values, scaling numeric features, and encoding categorical variables.

2. Feature Selection: Selecting relevant attributes for clustering based on domain knowledge and data exploration. It's important to choose attributes that best represent player profiles and aid in meaningful segmentation.

3. K-means Clustering: Applying the K-means algorithm to the selected features. The algorithm iteratively assigns players to clusters based on their attribute distances and updates cluster centroids until convergence.

4. Cluster Interpretation: Analyzing the resulting player clusters to gain insights into player profiles. This involves examining the characteristics and tendencies of players within each cluster, identifying patterns and trends.

## Usage
To use the FIFA player segmentation model, follow these steps:

* Preprocess the input dataset according to the provided guidelines in the fifa_players_clustering.ipynb script. This ensures the data is in the appropriate format and scales for clustering.

* Select the relevant attributes from the preprocessed dataset to be used for clustering. Modify the attribute selection code in the feature_selection.py script to suit your requirements.

* Run the fifa_players_clustering.ipynb script, providing the preprocessed dataset and selected features as input. The script will perform K-means clustering and output the resulting player clusters.

* Analyze and interpret the player clusters to gain insights into the different segments of FIFA players.

## Evaluation
Evaluation of the clustering model can be performed through various means, such as silhouette scores, elbow method, or domain-specific evaluation metrics. Assessing the quality and coherence of the clusters helps understand the effectiveness of the segmentation and identify any potential improvements.
